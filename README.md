# Food Mart Analysis

Welcome to the **Food Mart Analysis** project! This Tableau-based data analytics project provides a comprehensive overview of key metrics, trends, and insights related to customer demographics, product sales, and store performance.

## Project Overview

The Food Mart Analysis project was designed to extract meaningful insights from retail data, combining **data visualization** techniques, **trend analysis**, and **geospatial mapping**. The analysis includes interactive dashboards and key performance indicators (KPIs) to help businesses make data-driven decisions.

## Key Features

- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Track essential business metrics like sales, profit, product quantities, and store performance for a snapshot of overall health.
- **Trend Analysis**: Visualize patterns over time to uncover trends in sales and customer counts, supporting strategic planning.
- **Geospatial Mapping**: Map store locations to examine regional performance and demographic data, giving insight into location-specific strategies.
- **Customer Demographics**: Analyze age, gender, and income distributions to understand customer profiles and inform marketing and product decisions.
- **Interactive Parameters**: Customize your view with interactive parameters, allowing users to explore different dimensions of the data.

## Insights Gained

Through this analysis, we uncovered insights in several areas:

- Identified trends in customer demographics and product demand, crucial for targeted marketing.
- Gained visibility into store performance across regions, supporting location-specific strategies.
- Enabled data interaction, making it easy for users to explore insights independently.
